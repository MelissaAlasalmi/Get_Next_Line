# Get_Next_Line
✅ Project score: 123/100 ✅  
A function that reads a line, ending with a newline character, from a file descriptor (stdin, stdout, etc.). Doesn't sound like much, but it taught me a lot about memory management and it has really come in handy for other school projects, like [Filler](https://github.com/MelissaAlasalmi/Filler).
